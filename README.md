# Depression_detection
Depression detection is a research project to build an app which takes speech as input and predicts the
mood and depression state of the user. We used deep learning to achieve the goal.

DAIC-WOZ dataset is used for model training.

Models used: ConvLSTM - spectrograms, LSTM - Transcripts
